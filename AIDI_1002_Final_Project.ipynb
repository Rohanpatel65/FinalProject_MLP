    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project reproduces and extends the methodology from the GitHub project [COVID19-Algeria-and-World-Dataset](https://github.com/SamBelkacem/COVID19-Algeria-and-World-Dataset) and associated [research paper](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/covid-19-data-analysis-and-forecasting).  \n",
    "We use a global COVID-19 dataset to understand and model pandemic trends across different continents using machine learning models.\n",

    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reproduce** baseline models to predict total COVID-19 cases  \n",
    "2. **Contribute** significantly by:\n",
    "   - Applying the methodology at the **continent level**\n",
    "   - Comparing performance of:\n",
    "     - Linear Regression\n",
    "     - Random Forest Regressor\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Source**: [OWID COVID-19 dataset](https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/covid)\n",
    "- **File Used**: `owid-covid-data.csv`\n",
    "- **Important Features**:\n",
    "  - `new_cases`, `new_deaths`, `icu_patients`, `hosp_patients`, `positive_rate`, `people_fully_vaccinated`, `total_tests`\n",
    "- **Target Variable**:\n",
    "  - `total_cases`\n",

    "## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Distribution\n",
    "\n",
    "Histograms were generated for key features to understand their spread and detect any outliers or skewness.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Correlation Heatmap\n",
    "\n",
    "A heatmap using the latest available data per country was generated to show correlations between variables. Strong relationships were found between `new_cases`, `positive_rate`, and `total_cases`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Total Cases/Deaths Over Time\n",
    "\n",
    "Time series line plots were created for `total_cases` and `total_deaths`, grouped by continent, showing how the pandemic evolved over time across regions.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Modeling and Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "We trained the following regression models per continent to predict `total_cases`:\n",
    "- **Linear Regression** (baseline)\n",
    "- **Random Forest Regressor** (handles non-linearity and feature interactions)\n",
    "- **MLP Regressor** (neural network for modeling complex patterns)\n",

    "### Model Configuration\n",
    "\n",
    "- Train-test split: 80/20  \n",
    "- Random seed: 42  \n",
