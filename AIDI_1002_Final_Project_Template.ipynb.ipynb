    "## üìå Conclusion\n",
    "In this project, we reproduced and extended the methodology from the original research on COVID-19 data analysis. By using the globally trusted \"Our World in Data\" COVID-19 dataset, we performed an in-depth study of COVID-19 trends at the continent level, exploring how machine learning models can be used to predict the total number of cases using relevant features such as new cases, new deaths, testing, and positive rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "We implemented and evaluated three machine learning models: Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP). These models were trained and tested independently for each continent, and their performances were compared using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) as the evaluation metric. The results showed that ensemble models like Random Forest generally performed better than Linear Regression, while MLP also showed competitive results depending on the data size and feature variability of each continent.\n",
    "\n",
    "we further visualized the feature distributions, correlation heatmaps, and time-series trends of COVID-19 cases and deaths. These visualizations provided valuable insights into the pandemic's evolution and helped identify which variables had strong predictive power.\n",
